This project implements a Budget Application for users to create customized budgets. User's create an account and can then create a budgets. For each budget a user sets his income and adds categories to it. The amount budgeted in a budget is automatically tracked to help the user know how much of their income the user has been budgetted. Categories include the name of the category and the amount budgeted for it. The users can then add transactions. When adding a transaction, a user selects a budget which automatically selects a list of categories in that budget for the user to assign a transaction to. Transactions also require the merchant, amount, and the date of the transaction. Categories and budgets automatically update with the amount spent based on the transactions assigned to them. Budgets, categories, and transactions all have the ability to be edited and deleted as well if the user makes a mistake. Users can also change their passwords and reset them in the event that a password is forgotten. Users are restricted to acessing only their own budgets and no-outside individual can acess a user's budget.
